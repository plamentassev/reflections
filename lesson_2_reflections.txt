git diff -	 	-	find diferences git diff. git diff considers the first argument as the "original",+
					and the second argument as the "new" version, so additions are lines present in the second argument but not the first
git clone
scp 			-	secure copy, only grabs the content not the history (commits) of a repository
git log 		-  	changes (commits) log, starts from the last change made to the repository
git init 		-  	create repository
git status 		- 	show which files have changed since the last commit
git add			-	adds files to the repository

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Initialized is an empty repository. I guess we need git that we are starting a new repository, we can only add files to and existing repository, so it is a 2 step process
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area actually contains files that are ready to be committed / the working directory may contain files we don;t want to commit such as log files or temp files
	The repository contains files that are committed and can be shared with other user or stored in an online repository
